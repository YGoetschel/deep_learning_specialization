# deep_learning_specialization

Dear Developers,

You may find my various projects undertaken by following the course: Deep Learning Specialization provided by Deeplearning.ai

You may find all the videos of the specialization on Deeplearning's page on Youtube.

Each course contains a set of assignments to be completed.

   The jupyter notebook files are the original assignments

   The python file contain my solutions to the assignment

Don't forget, there is no one way to code! So feel free to get inspired and come up with your own version. 

Best of luck and happy coding
